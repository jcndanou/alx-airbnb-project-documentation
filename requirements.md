# üìù Detailed Functional Specifications

Here are the detailed specifications for the three requested features:

1. User Authentication

Description: This module manages user registration and login, ensuring secure and role-based access to the platform.

Functional Requirements:

    User Registration:

        The system must allow new users to register by providing a unique email address, first name, last name, a secure password, and specifying their initial role (guest or host).

        The password must be hashed and salted before being stored in the database.

        Server-side validation must be performed for email uniqueness and password complexity.

        API Endpoint: POST /api/register

            Input: JSON { "first_name": "string", "last_name": "string", "email": "string", "password": "string", "role": "guest" | "host" }

            Output (Success): 201 Created, JSON { "user_id": "uuid", "message": "User registered successfully" }

            Output (Error): 400 Bad Request (e.g., email already in use, weak password), 500 Internal Server Error

    User Login:

        The system must allow users to log in with their email address and password.

        Upon successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) must be generated and returned to the client. This token will have a defined validity period.

        The system must support OAuth authentication via third-party services (e.g., Google, Facebook).

        API Endpoint: POST /api/login

            Input: JSON { "email": "string", "password": "string" }

            Output (Success): 200 OK, JSON { "token": "jwt_token", "user_id": "uuid", "role": "string" }

            Output (Error): 401 Unauthorized (incorrect credentials), 500 Internal Server Error

    Profile Management:

        Authenticated users must be able to retrieve and update their profile information (first name, last name, phone number, profile photos, preferences).

        Profile photos must be stored on a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary).

        API Endpoint: GET /api/users/{user_id}, PUT /api/users/{user_id}

            Authorization: Requires a valid JWT. A user can only modify their own profile, except for administrators.

2. Property Management

Description: This module allows hosts to create, view, modify, and delete their property listings, and guests to search and view them.

Functional Requirements:

    Add Property:

        A user with the host role must be able to create a new listing.

        Required information includes name, description, location, price per night, and amenities.

        Property images must be uploadable and stored via a file storage service.

        API Endpoint: POST /api/properties

            Authorization: Requires a valid JWT with the host role.

            Input: JSON { "name": "string", "description": "string", "location": "string", "price_per_night": "decimal", "amenities": ["string"], "images": ["url"] }

            Output (Success): 201 Created, JSON { "property_id": "uuid", "message": "Property created successfully" }

            Output (Error): 400 Bad Request (missing/invalid data), 403 Forbidden (unauthorized role), 500 Internal Server Error

    Modify/Delete Property:

        A host can only modify or delete their own properties. An administrator can modify/delete any property.

        Deleting a property must handle the cascading deletion of associated bookings (or mark them as canceled if a retention policy is in place).

        API Endpoint: PUT /api/properties/{property_id}, DELETE /api/properties/{property_id}

            Authorization: Requires a valid JWT with the host role (for their own property) or admin.

            Output (Success): 200 OK (PUT), 204 No Content (DELETE)

            Output (Error): 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error

    Search and Filter Properties:

        The system must allow searching for properties by location, price range, number of guests, and amenities.

        Search results must be paginated to handle large datasets.

        API Endpoint: GET /api/properties

            Query Parameters: location, min_price, max_price, guests, amenities, page, limit

            Output (Success): 200 OK, JSON [ { "property_id": "uuid", "name": "string", ... }, ... ]

            Output (Error): 400 Bad Request (invalid parameters), 500 Internal Server Error

3. Booking System

Description: This module manages the creation, viewing, and cancellation of property bookings, including availability verification and status tracking.

Functional Requirements:

    Create Booking:

        A user (guest) can create a booking for a specific property and given dates.

        The system must validate property availability for the requested dates before confirming the booking, preventing double bookings.

        The total price must be calculated based on the price per night and the duration.

        The initial booking status is pending.

        API Endpoint: POST /api/bookings

            Authorization: Requires a valid JWT with the guest role.

            Input: JSON { "property_id": "uuid", "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }

            Output (Success): 201 Created, JSON { "booking_id": "uuid", "status": "pending", "total_price": "decimal", "message": "Booking created, awaiting confirmation" }

            Output (Error): 400 Bad Request (invalid/unavailable dates), 403 Forbidden (unauthorized role), 404 Not Found (property not found), 500 Internal Server Error

    Cancel Booking:

        Users (guests) can cancel their own bookings. Hosts can cancel bookings for their properties. Administrators can cancel any booking.

        Cancellation must update the booking status to canceled and potentially initiate a refund process (which falls under the payment module).

        API Endpoint: PUT /api/bookings/{booking_id}/cancel

            Authorization: Requires a valid JWT (guest for their own booking, host for a booking on their property, admin).

            Output (Success): 200 OK, JSON { "booking_id": "uuid", "status": "canceled", "message": "Booking cancelled successfully" }

            Output (Error): 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict (booking already completed or uncancelable), 500 Internal Server Error

    View and Track Bookings:

        Users must be able to view their list of bookings with their status (pending, confirmed, canceled, completed).

        Hosts can view bookings for their properties.

        API Endpoint: GET /api/bookings (for current user), GET /api/properties/{property_id}/bookings (for host), GET /api/bookings/{booking_id}

            Authorization: Requires a valid JWT.

            Output (Success): 200 OK, JSON [ { "booking_id": "uuid", "property_name": "string", "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "status": "string", ... }, ... ]

            Output (Error): 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error
